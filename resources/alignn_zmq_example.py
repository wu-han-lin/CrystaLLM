"""
This file is intended as an example of setting up an ALIGNN model to listen
for and respond to prediction requests using ZMQ.

A minimal set of dependencies required for this example would be:
Python 3.9
pyzmq = 25.1.1
alignn = 2023.8.1

It may be best, and even necessary, to create a separate Python environment
for this process when interoperating with a process running the MCTS code in
this repository, for example, since there could be conflicting dependency
requirements.
